After many years of running trials for our school’s robotics club, some of our members, including myself, started to notice something off. Every year, without fail, we picked students who performed well in interviews—confident, well-spoken, with solid copmetition experience and excellent answers to our technical questions. 

But once they joined the CCA, many of them couldn’t troubleshoot simple problems, didn’t put in any effort, and struggled to work without step-by-step instructions. 
Without fail, we’d also end up with one or two kids who, while technically competent on paper, just didn’t have good vibes  - they either lacked basic communication skills, were overly rigid, or created tension in group settings.


We realized we’d been selecting based on who could talk about robotics — not necessarily who could think through problems, apply knowledge, or work independently — and it became abundantly clear that technical ability alone wasn’t enough; fit, collaboration, and emotional intelligence mattered just as much, if not more.

It didn’t help that we already knew how some robotics enrichment centres in Singapore operated—feeding students model answers to common interview questions and building most of the robot for them, just to pad their portfolios. So when these students showed up with polished slides and zero actual understanding, it wasn’t a surprise. We saw the problem coming, and decided to tackle both issues—performance-based interviews and surface-level experience—in one fell swoop.

We took the gamble and reworked our trial system.

Instead of having 2 on 1 interviews, we swapped to a group interview format, observing how our applicants interacted with one another. Instead of throwing questions at them, we **taught all applicants the core concepts** they needed— we ran through the physics behind vectors over 1 hour, and asked them to apply it to omni wheels.. Then we just watched:

- Who asked good questions?
- Who could apply what they just learned to a new problem?
- Who could reason instead of guessing?

That shift made all the difference. The students who stood out weren’t the ones with rehearsed answers or perfect resumes. They were the ones who **thought critically**, **made connections**, **tested ideas**, and **built off the knowledge** they were given. Even if they didn’t know everything, they *knew how to learn* and were *genuinely nice kids*, and that was way more valuable.

And I think that this applies to any interview you can think of. **Any experience or opportunity in life should exist only to develop oneself further.** If you're looking for someone who can already do the work, that just means that your organisation is built on limiting others' potential.
